<b><p>Hi There! My name is Umar (Omar) Shahbaz, welcome to my Portfolio Website. A little about myself, I am a 20 year old Saudi student, who is doing IT with a major in Tech Management. I have been doing IT as early as the 6th Grade, and when I was choosing a degree to purse, I knew, regardless of what field it is, it had to involve IT.</p>
<p>When I looked into Tech Management at Ontario Tech University, I knew if there was any academic endeavour I could commit to, it would be this program. The middle ground between Technology and Business leaves me with countless opportunities to experiment with to find my niche.
<p>Besides academics, I make music, having taught myself guitar and beginner theory in piano. I like to read life-based books, whether they be on business or human nature in any form.</p>
<p>I'd say playing my guitar in my spare time, or any time of the day to be honest, is my go-to hobby. I am always looking for more ways to improve my hand on the guitar, since it has been less than a year since I started playing</p>
<p>Here's a video of me testing a chord progression <sub>(with palm-muting!)</sub>: </p>
